# Red-Black Tree

This repository contains an implementation of a red-black tree in Java.

## Description

A red-black tree is a type of self-balancing binary search tree that can be used to store data in key-value pairs. This implementation includes two main classes:

- `RedBlackTree`: contains the implementation of basic operations like `search`, `insert`, `delete`, `isEmpty`, and `display`.
- `RedBlackTreeUserInput`: takes input from the user and switches it to know what operation the user wants to do.

## Installation

To use this implementation of a red-black tree in your own project, you can simply copy the `RedBlackTree.java` file into your project directory or clone this repository using Git :    &emsp;    &emsp; `git clone repoLink`
